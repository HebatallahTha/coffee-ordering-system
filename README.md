# Coffee Order Program

## Description

The Coffee Order Program is an interactive console-based system developed in C that allows users to order different types of coffee with customizable options. The program presents a list of coffee flavors, asks the user for size preferences, cream and sugar options, and then summarizes the order. It also ensures that all coffee flavors are chosen before the program ends.

## Features:
- **Coffee Options:** The user can choose from five types of coffee: House, Iced, Vanilla, Hazelnut, Mocha.
- **Size Selection:** The user can choose from Small, Medium, or Large sizes.
- **Customization:** The program allows the user to add cream and/or sugar to their coffee.
- **Order Summary:** Once the order is placed, the program displays a summary of the coffee order and calculates the total price based on the size selected.
